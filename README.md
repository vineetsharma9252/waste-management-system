    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-management.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Use the `start_servers.py` script to run both the Django website and the Streamlit app:

   This script will:
   - Launch the Django server and open the website at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
